# STM32 Servo Motor Control with Potentiometer
This repository contains the code for controlling a servo motor using an STM32 microcontroller and a potentiometer. The code uses PWM signals generated by the microcontroller to control the position of the servo motor, and reads the input from a potentiometer to set the desired position.

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32 microcontroller (tested on STM32F407G-DISC1)
- Servo motor
- Potentiometer
- Breadboard and jumper wires
## Software Requirements
- STM32CubeIDE (tested on version 1.8.0)
- STM32F4xx HAL library
## Setup
**1.** Connect the servo motor to the STM32 microcontroller as follows:

- Servo signal pin to STM32 PWM output pin (e.g., PA0)
- Servo power pin to 5V pin on STM32 board
- Servo ground pin to GND pin on STM32 board

**2.** Connect the potentiometer to the STM32 microcontroller as follows:
- Potentiometer signal pin to ADC input pin on STM32 (e.g., PA1)
- Potentiometer power pin to 3.3V pin on STM32 board
- Potentiometer ground pin to GND pin on STM32 board

**3.** Open STM32CubeIDE and import the project from this repository.

**4.** Build and flash the code onto the STM32 microcontroller.
## Usage
- Connect the STM32 microcontroller to a power source.
- Turn the potentiometer to set the desired position of the servo motor.
- The servo motor should move to the desired position.
## Troubleshooting
- If the servo motor does not move, check that it is connected correctly to the STM32 microcontroller and that the power source is supplying enough current to drive 
the motor.
- If the servo motor moves erratically or does not move to the correct position, try adjusting the potentiometer and/or calibrating the servo motor.
